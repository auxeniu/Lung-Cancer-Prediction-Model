## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3 and `pip` installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/lung-cancer-risk-prediction.git
    cd lung-cancer-risk-prediction
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1.  Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nancyalaswad90/lung-cancer/data) and place the `survey lung cancer.csv` file in the `data/` directory.
2.  Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `notebooks/lung_cancer_analysis.ipynb` to see the entire analysis, from EDA to model training.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/lung_cancer_analysis.ipynb
    ```

## üìà Key Steps and Results

### 1. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
-   Removed 33 duplicate entries.
-   Encoded categorical variables (e.g., 'M'/'F' -> 1/0, 'YES'/'NO' -> 1/0).
-   Standardized column names by stripping whitespace.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-   Visualized the severe class imbalance (87% YES vs. 13% NO).
-   Identified age as a significant risk factor (median age ~65 for cancer cases).
-   Discovered strong gender-based patterns in smoking and alcohol consumption.
-   Analyzed correlations, finding features like `ALLERGY` and `SWALLOWING DIFFICULTY` to be most correlated with the target.

### 3. Feature Engineering
-   Created interaction terms: `CHEST PAIN_Alcohol`, `Wheezing_Coughing`, `ANXIETY_YELLOW_FINGERS`.

### 4. Handling Class Imbalance
-   Applied **ADASYN** to balance the training set, successfully creating a 1:1 class ratio.

### 5. Model Training & Evaluation
Eight models were trained and evaluated on a held-out test set. Key results:

| Model | Accuracy | AUC-ROC |
| :------------------------ | :------- | :------ |
| **Gaussian Naive Bayes**  | **94.6%**  | 91.7%   |
| **Support Vector Classifier** | 92.9%   | **97.5%**  |
| **Logistic Regression**   | 91.1%   | 97.2%   |
| Random Forest             | 91.1%   | 96.8%   |
| K-Nearest Neighbors       | 89.3%   | 92.6%   |

**Final Model Selection:** **Logistic Regression** was chosen as the best model due to its excellent combination of high accuracy (91.1%), high AUC (97.2%), and most importantly, its **consistency and top performance in cross-validation** (91.36% ¬± 2.23%), making it a reliable and interpretable choice.

## üîÆ Future Work

-   Experiment with advanced techniques like SMOTE and different undersampling strategies.
-   Perform hyperparameter tuning on the top-performing models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVC) to further optimize performance.
-   Deploy the best model as a simple web application using Flask or Streamlit for interactive risk assessment.
-   Explore deep learning models for comparison.
